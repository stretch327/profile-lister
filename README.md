Apple Development Profile lister/maintainer

## Description
When diagnosing Xojo iOS issues, I find that the majority of issues involve expired, invalid or duplicate profiles. This tool will list the profiles currently installed on your computer. Items shown in Red expired in the past while items that are Orange expire in less than a week.

You can remove expired items by selecting Edit > Profiles > Cleanup or pressing CMD-K.

To refresh the list, select Edit > Profiles > Refresh or press CMD-R.
